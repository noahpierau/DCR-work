# Decred messaging proposal - community money

## Overview

There is a [new RFP](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/91becea) on Politiea that aims to solicit community feedback around Decred's messaging and includes an [example post](https://gist.github.com/RichardRed0x/22c584e7fd9413c1a3f3284069998892) that iterates some of the copy.

Narratives and marketing approaches to explain the project to outsiders have shifted over time and i see this as a natural process. Multiple narratives may coexist, this is something we [see in Bitcoin](https://uncommoncore.co/visions-of-bitcoin-how-major-bitcoin-narratives-changed-over-time/) as well. 

Institutional investors such as [Blockhead Capital](https://www.blockheadcap.com/post/decred-investment-thesis) and [Placeholder](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2018/5/12/decred-investment-thesis) (among others) have outlined their DCR investment theses and community members have offered [alternative narrative paths](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hg2a9k/forward_thinking_friday_decred_narratives_26_june/). All these different ways of explaing Decred are relevant for this RFP.

In this post, i will critically examine the suggested copy and collect alternative ways of telling Decred's message to the world.


## Thinking through messaging

In any narrative development there are typically four key stages. This approach used by @mrbulb gives structure to storytelling and it applies pretty much universally - from business to filmmaking and yes, even crypto-networks.

    Insight - the big picture, what is the context to the story you are telling?

    Problem - within the context you have framed, what is the primary issue?

    Solution - what is the compelling answer to the problem and context you have set?

    How it works - so now explain how the solution works, from high level to deep dive...


Example:

Let's take the (simplified) original positioning of the world's most famous computing brand.

    Insight - Computers will change the world but...

    Problem - Right now they are difficult to use...

    Solution - Introducing Apple. We make computers normal people can use.

    How it works - An intuitive human machine interface etc etc.

You can see how Apple benefitted from Steve Job's marketing insight [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keCwRdbwNQY) and is where the 'Think Different' slogan was born from. Note that the slogan isn't about the technology, it's about what human sensibility the technology appeals to... He uses the same framework, the 'why' comes before the 'what'. 

Let's check Decred's positioning on the current website against this structure.

    Insight - ?

    Problem - ?

    Solution - Introducing Decred, a community directed superior store of value.

    How it works - It is secure. It is sustainable. It is adaptable.

Currently Decred's introduction misses two key steps - context and problem.

For many in the community those steps may be self-evident, but for newcomers and for those less well versed in the history of Bitcoin (aka the vast majority of crypto) it is much harder to grasp the key stages of the story.

An example revison of Decred's positioning statements.

    Insight - The existing financial system is inherently broken...

    Problem - There is no way to reliably store and transact value on the internet, BTC has failed to remain decentralized 

    Solution - Introducing Decred, a community directed superior store of value

    How it works - It is secure, it is sustainable, it is adaptable.

    Details... PoW/PoS hybrid system, treasury reward, Politeia...

The details above are on the website, but the narrative is not immediately clear.

Technology can be world leading, but if the story doesn't connect, the tech alone won't matter. The reverse is also true: great storytelling will take you a long way, but if there aren't strong foundations to back up your claims, then trust will be shortlived. 

#### Things to consider 

- The order of text really matters - prioritise. 
- Aim for reduction and simplicity at every stage - this will create impact. 
- Consider the messaging is aimed at reaching and influencing - test it out. 

#### Key questions

What is the core insight at the heart of the message? 

Which audience is the narrative aimed at and why? 

## Examination of current proposal 

The proposed new messaging is: Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money. 

Personally, i think this lacks creativity and vision. It's trying to *describe* the project but uses the wrong words. Let's examine why:

1. every crypto project is stakeholder governed, so that's not unique to DCR. Especially when you use a wide definition of the term stakeholder (benevolent dictators also hold coins). The differentiator rather is: permissionless formal governance systems that are resistant to censorship.
2. while i don't know much about sound money, in two definitions i could find via duckduckgo it says: "Sound money is money that is not prone to sudden appreciation or depreciation in purchasing power over the long term" and "money not liable to sudden appreciation or depreciation in value : stable money". It seems the word "sound" does not really apply to DCR in this definition, because the price at which DCR was valued has changed significantly over the last few years.
3. the RFP also promintently mentions "fairness" which is another questionable word choice. The question "fair for whom? " is relevant here. Maybe Decred is only fair to people who bought DCR for a low price? Because for others it may not feel fair.

## Suggested changes

Everyone has been invited to participate in the messaging RFP. To me, this symbolizes the true spirit of Decred: a digital collective of sovereign individuals who work together to create value.

The core insight, to me, is that we live in disruptive times in which many activities are moving to the digital realm. Online collaboration with strangers is the next frontier for humanity. 

Let's explore Decred's positioning:

    Insights - in current disruptive times, our lives are increasingly moving to the digital realm. we can not rely of previous financial system to preserve our wealth 

    Problem - wealth is best protected when people work together. however, online collaboration to create, store and transact value is difficult (especially with strangers)

    Solution - introducing Decred, a digital collective of sovereign individuals who create, store and transact value in a trustless way 

    How it works - value can be created in multiple ways (code, content, art, music, video) and is stored and transacted in DCR


What would the tagline change to? 

* Decred is a digital collective of sovereign individuals 
* DCR is community money that is Secure, Adaptable, Sustainable 


#### How these changes impact other aspects of the site

Change as little as possible. 

To be determined. 


## About me

Airdrop unicorn, Decred community member since day 0. 

My story: [noahpierau.github.io](https://noahpierau.github.io/)

- I have worked alongside _ingsoc and jz to build Decred's community from the ground up. 
- I have helped several valued contractors get started with working for Decred. 
- I have represented the project on social media and during offline events.


## Estimate of costs for changes + help required from others

I plan to change as little of the existing website as possible. I would only change the messaging / narrative on the homepage and in other strategic places such as link previews and social media descriptions.

I am estimating the cost of producing the new copy to be $400, which covers the work already done to prepare the draft, plus some time spent considering and implementing feedback on further changes to it.

As decred.org is in 12 languages, this new copy would have to be translated 11 times. I am estimating $100 for each translation for an estimated total of $1,100. This is a difficult one to estimate, and my estimate is based on the information that translation of the other site content took 5-8 hours per language.

## Costs

| Item           | Estimated Cost | Maximum Budget |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Copy           | 400            | 600            |
| Translation    | 1100           | 1400           |
| Implementation | 300            | 400            |
| Total          | 1800           | 2400           |

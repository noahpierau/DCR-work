# Decred messaging proposal - community money

## Overview

There is a [new RFP](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/91becea) on Politiea that aims to solicit community feedback around Decred's messaging and includes an [example post](https://gist.github.com/RichardRed0x/22c584e7fd9413c1a3f3284069998892) that iterates some of the copy. 

In this post, i will critically examine the suggested copy and collect alternative ways of telling Decred's message to the world.

Narratives and marketing approaches to explain the project to outsiders have shifted over time and i see this as a natural process. Multiple narratives may coexist, this is something we [see in Bitcoin](https://uncommoncore.co/visions-of-bitcoin-how-major-bitcoin-narratives-changed-over-time/) as well. 

Institutional investors such as[Blockhead Capital](https://www.blockheadcap.com/post/decred-investment-thesis) and [Placeholder](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2018/5/12/decred-investment-thesis) among others have  outlined their DCR 'investment' theses, whilst community members have offered [alternative narrative paths](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hg2a9k/forward_thinking_friday_decred_narratives_26_june/). All these different ways of explaing Decred are relevant for this RFP.


## Thinking through messaging

In any narrative development there are typically four key stages. This approach used by @mrbulb gives structure to storytelling and it applies pretty much universally - from business to filmmaking and yes, even crypto-networks.

    Insight - the big picture, what is the context to the story you are telling?

    Problem - within the context you have framed, what is the primary issue?

    Solution - what is the compelling answer to the problem and context you have set?

    How it works - so now explain how the solution works, from high level to deep dive...


Example:

Let's take the (simplified) original positioning of the world's most famous computing brand.

    Insight - Computers will change the world but...

    Problem - Right now they are difficult to use...

    Solution - Introducing Apple. We make computers normal people can use.

    How it works - An intuitive human machine interface etc etc.

You can see how Apple benefitted from Steve Job's marketing insight [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keCwRdbwNQY) and is where the 'Think Different' slogan was born from. Note that the slogan isn't about the technology, it's about what human sensibility the technology appeals to... He uses the same framework, the 'why' comes before the 'what'. 

Let's check Decred's positioning (per website) against this structure.

    Insight - ?

    Problem - ?

    Solution - Introducing Decred, a community directed superior store of value.

    How it works - It is secure. It is sustainable. It is adaptable.

Currently Decred's introduction misses two key steps - context and problem.

For many in the community those steps may be self-evident, but for newcomers and for those less well versed in the history of Bitcoin (aka the vast majority of crypto) it is much harder to grasp the key stages of the story.

An example revison of Decred's positioning statements.

    Insight - The existing financial system is inherently broken...

    Problem - There is no way to store and transact value on the internet

    Solution - Introducing Decred, a community directed superior store of value

    How it works - It is secure, it is sustainable, it is adaptable.

    Details... PoW/PoS hybrid system, treasury reward, politeia...

The details above are on the website, but the narrative does not have a clear through line.

Technology can be world leading, but if the story doesn't connect, the tech alone won't matter. The reverse is also true. Great storytelling will take you a long way, but if there aren't strong foundations to back up your claims, then trust will be shortlived. 

#### Things to consider 

- The order of text really matters - prioritise. 
- Aim for reduction and simplicity at every stage - this will create impact. 
- Consider the messaging is aimed at reaching and influencing - test it out on people / maybe discuss ideas on reddit. 

#### Key questions

What is the core insight at the heart of the message? 

Which audience is the narrative aimed at and why? 

## Examination of current proposal 

The proposed new messaging is Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money that is more Fair. 

Personally, i think it lacks creativity and vision. It's trying to describe the project but uses the wrong words (or words that do not resonate with me).

1. every crypto project is stakeholder governed, so that's not unique to DCR. Especially when you use a wide definition of the term stakeholder (benevolent dictators also hold coins). The differentiator rather is: permissionless formal governance systems that are resistant to censorship.
2. while i don't know much about sound money, in two definitions i could find via duckduckgo it says: "Sound money is money that is not prone to sudden appreciation or depreciation in purchasing power over the long term" and "money not liable to sudden appreciation or depreciation in value : stable money". It seems the word "sound" does not really apply to DCR in this definition, because the price at which DCR was valued has changed significantly over the last few years.
3. the RFP also mentioned "fair" which is another risky word choice. The question "fair for whom" is relevant here. Maybe Decred is fair to people who picked up DCR for a low price? Because for others it may not feel fair.

## Summarise your changes here

What would the tagline change to? 

* Decred supports independent communities around the world
* DCR is community money that is Secure, Adaptable, Sustainable 

What other changes would you make (be detailed)? 

Do these changes impact any other aspects of the site?

For example: 

### Amend / Change copy here:

```
Fair
The Decred network is available to all, and the rules are the same for everyone. Decred is governed by its stakeholders, who time-lock some of their decentralized credits in exchange for tickets, using these to vote and make decisions about the Decred network and DCR asset's future.

### Amend / Change / Reorder Page copy and headlines here:

> Contributors to the Decred project have a shared ambition, to build a fairer financial system by leveraging open source cryptocurrency software. Decentralized Credits (DCR) are the currency of this fairer financial system, everyone can own and use them - and have a voice in governance of the network if they choose to.

> **The Fiat Currency Game is Rigged**

> Our national fiat currencies and associated payment rails are controlled by a network of elites representing banks and public institutions. Cryptocurrency is about producing an alternative infrastructure for money, which is less susceptible to being captured and controlled by an elite because it is decentralized and permissionless. Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin, which relies on transparent distributed records and a game of computational power to ensure that everyone follows the rules and the network as a whole operates as intended. The consensus rules of the network bind all of its users together, and they stipulate an issuance schedule for the currency, which has been followed faithfully since launch. The distributed network and permissionless mining means it is difficult to stop or censor someone's transactions as long as they follow the network's rules.

> **Blockchain Governance Matters**

> Cryptocurrency networks rely on their software to enforce the rules of the network, known as consensus rules, because it is consensus on how to apply these rules that keeps the network together and functional. Software must be continuously maintained and improved, for cryptocurrencies this means in practice that sometimes the consensus rules need to be amended. Decred was founded on the insight that governance is a major challenge for decentralized networks, because there are many competing interests when it comes to making changes. Decred's solution was to include a formal method of making these decisions from the beginning, so that new users know from the outset how its governance works, transparently managing expectations.

> **Aligned Incentives, Skin in the Game**

> Decred's position is that the best way to decentralize governance of a cryptocurrency fairly is to distribute decision-making power among the people who hold its asset - DCR in this case. However, giving voting rights to everyone who is holding DCR and could immediately sell it is open to abuse. Therefore Decred's design introduced a requirement that in order to participate in Proof-of-Stake voting a user must time-lock some of their DCR to secure a ticket. When stakeholders use DCR to secure a ticket, they cannot spend it until that ticket has voted - which can take up to 142 days. For more information about Proof-of-Stake voting, see the [documentation site](https://docs.decred.org/proof-of-stake/overview/).

> Learn about Decred's rules, which are the same for everyone, and put the holders of decentralized credits in charge of running the network.

## Website Mockups 

Ideally each RFP proposal would be mocked up on a test site such as has been done [here](https://dcrweb.jamieholdstock.com/).

This would require a little extra help from someone like Jamie and would be a good thing to do for all viable proposals so they can be compared equally.

## About you (or your collective)

Tell us a little bit about your journey to Decred and share any community contributions. 

## Supporting work - estimate costs for changes and help required from others. 

**Make any amends to the below if you are suggesting any extra assets or elements.**

The extra box on the home page would need a background graphic, and the Fair page would need three images. The cost for these to be produced by the same design contributors who worked on the rest of the site is estimated to be $600-1200.

To be consistent with the other pages, the Fair page would need a video. However, the videos are not very prominent on the page so we have decided to forego a new "Fair" video as this would be a significant additional cost and would likely take quite some time to produce.

The new elements follow existing patterns so the amount of work needed to add them on the site is relatively small. @jholdstock has already done the key parts of this to put up the demo site, the estimate for  implementation is $400.

I (@richardred) am estimating the cost of producing the new copy to be $400, which covers the work already done to prepare the draft, plus some time spent considering and implementing feedback on further changes to it.

As decred.org is in 12 languages, this new copy would have to be translated 11 times. I am estimating $100 for each translation for an estimated total of $1,100. This is a difficult one to estimate, and my estimate is based on the information that translation of the other site content took 5-8 hours per language.

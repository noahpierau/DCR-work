# Decred messaging proposal - community money

## Overview

There is a [new RFP](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/91becea) on Politiea that aims to solicit community feedback around Decred's messaging and includes an [example post](https://gist.github.com/RichardRed0x/22c584e7fd9413c1a3f3284069998892) that iterates some of the copy. 

It is worth reiterating that there are **two major aspects** to this initiative.

1. Decred is discussing changes to its messaging and by definition, articulating its value proposition.
2. This is the first RFP that solicits alternative proposals and then formalises the voting. 

The proposal contains a comment from Ammar, which prompted this post. 

    I'm interested in contributing towards this, but I am not a developer. If anyone is interested in partnering up, I'd be excited to help make this happen.

## What does success look like from a 'governance perspective'? 

Decred has pioneered many aspects of decentralised governance and the complex machinery that makes this possible, from the [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals) and voting system, to the [Contractor Management System](https://github.com/decred/contractor-mgmt) for aiding transparent delivery of approved proposals and the soon to be [decentralised treasury](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/ic0cit/jz_on_twitter_ive_been_watching_marco_peereboom/), which puts the fund in the hands of stakeholders.

The arrival of both the RFP process and a fundamental debate on the positioning of the project marks two new advances in this arena and provides a great platform to demonstrate both the utility of the system and the collective intelligence of a distributed community. 

Ammar ([here](https://medium.com/@Ammarooni/why-we-need-decred-an-inclusive-approach-to-sound-money-db2f990c107b)) and Checkmatey have written at length about their views on 'What Decred is' but as I'm sure they will also accept, their understanding and approach to explaining the project to outsiders has shifted over time. 

At the same time [Blockhead Capital](https://www.blockheadcap.com/post/decred-investment-thesis) and [Placeholder](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2018/5/12/decred-investment-thesis) among others have also outlined their 'investment' theses, whilst community members have also posited [alternative narrative paths](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hg2a9k/forward_thinking_friday_decred_narratives_26_june/). 

Personally this 'positioning' riddle has been at the heart of many of my [interactions](https://github.com/monsieurbulb/forksintheroad) with the community, so I am fascinated to see this process play out. 

Success with this RFP will come when there are a range of proposals, each bringing different insights that can be weighed against each other in a formal setting. 

Therefore the intention of this piece is two fold:

1. Build on the example to offer a cheat sheet of sorts for those wishing to develop and submit alternative proposals.
2. Lower the barrier to entry for submissions and in turn drive meaningful use of the RFP system.
3. Procure interesting perspectives and insights from the community that can iterate/evolve the messaging. 

## Thinking through messaging

For those who already have strong views on the way they would position Decred the following may be useful, for those who have some ideas or instincts but no framework with which to test your messaging, then hopefully this will be helpful. 

### Step 1.

Login / create a Github account, fork this gist and rename it to something distinctive. 

e.g. DCR-storeofvalue-proposal, DCR-dao-proposal, 'DCR-cyberneticorganism-proposal'. 

### Step 2.

Work through the steps below 

*Note: Some of the following was first posted as a '[workshop wednesday](https://https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hj7n52/what_is_decred_workshopwednesday/)' on Decred's Reddit.*

In any narrative development there are typically four key stages.

This approach gives structure to storytelling and applies pretty much universally - from business to filmmaking and yes, even crypto-networks.

    Insight - the big picture, what is the context to the story you are telling?

    Problem - within the context you have framed, what is the primary issue?

    Solution - what is the compelling answer to the problem and context you have set?

    How it works - so now explain how the solution works, from high level to deep dive...

This structured approach can waterfall across every aspect of a project, from a helicopter perspective to deep down into the weeds of a complex technology such as the DEX.

(Depending on your experience and expertise, helicopter and deep in the weeds are also subjective).

Over time these narratives will evolve, but the structure always stays the same.

It is also how Politeia proposals are generally structured.

Example:

Let's take the (simplified) original positioning of the world's most famous computing brand.

    Insight - Computers will change the world but...

    Problem - Right now they are difficult to use...

    Solution - Introducing Apple. We make computers normal people can use.

    How it works - An intuitive human machine interface etc etc.

You can see how Apple benefitted from Steve Job's marketing insight [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keCwRdbwNQY) and is where the 'Think Different' slogan was born from. Note that the slogan isn't about the technology, it's about what human sensibility the technology appeals to... He uses the same framework, the 'why' comes before the 'what'. 

The same applies to Nike's 'Just Do It'. It's not about explaining technology, it's about humanity. 

Let's check Decred's positioning (per website) against this structure.

    Insight - ?

    Problem - ?

    Solution - Introducing Decred, a community directed superior store of value 
    (this is **the concept** derived from the insight and problem).

    How it works - It is secure. It is sustainable. It is adaptable.

Currently Decred's introduction misses two key steps - context and problem.

For many in the community those steps are self-evident...

    There are two young fish swimming along who happen to meet an older fish.

    The older fish nods at them and says:

    ‘Morning boys, how’s the water?’

    The two young fish swim on for a bit and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and asks:

    ‘What the hell is water?’

    — David Foster Wallace.

For newcomers and indeed for those less well versed in the history of Bitcoin (aka the vast majority of crypto) it is much harder to grasp the key stages of the story.

An example revison of Decred's positioning statements.

    Insight - The existing financial system is unfair but...

    Problem - There is no way to store and transmit value on the internet

    Solution - Introducing Decred, a community directed superior store of value

    How it works - It is secure, it is sustainable, it is adaptable.

    Details... PoW/PoS hybrid system, treasury reward, politeia...

The details above are on the website, but the narrative does not have a clear through line.

Let's outline two other potential solutions (aka what Decred is for).

    Insight - ?

    Problem - ?

    Solution - Introducing Decred, a fairer financial system

    How it works -

    Details...

And also...

    Insight - ?

    Problem - ?

    Solution - Introducing Decred, financial & organisational infrastructue for DAOs.

    How it works -

    Details...

In many ways apathy is a symptom of poor narrative structure just as attention is the flip.

Technology can be world leading, but if the story doesn't connect that doesn't matter. The reverse is also true - great storytelling will take you a long way, but if the aren't strong foundations to back up your claims, then trust will be shortlived.

How would you use this narrative framework to bring alive Decred's various solutions?

You can find some previous inspiration in the comments of Forward Thinking Friday [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hg2a9k/forward_thinking_friday_decred_narratives_26_june/).

Using the original example as a base, take the insights, ideas and concepts you have refined in Step 2 and apply them to the copy. 

Some  advice: 

- The order of things really matters - prioritise messaging. 
- Aim for reduction and simplicity at every stage - this will create impact, rather than uncertainty. 
- Try not to be all things to all people - its a fast-track to appealing to no-one. 
- Consider the messaging is aimed at reaching and influencing - test it out on people / maybe discuss ideas on reddit. 

### Step 3.

- What is the core insight at the heart of your messaging proposal? 
- Which audience/s is your proposal aimed at and why? 

### Step 4.

Using the original example as a base, take the insights, ideas and concepts you have refined in **Step 2** and refined in **Step 3** and apply them to the copy (this helps everyone to see the thinking you have gone through). 

## Summarise your changes here

What would the tagline change to?: Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money 

What other changes would you make (be detailed)?: 

Do these changes impact any other aspects of the site?: 

For example: 

- This theme will have a box on the front page and its own page, as with Secure, Adaptable and Sustainable.

### Amend / Change copy here:

```
Fair
The Decred network is available to all, and the rules are the same for everyone. Decred is governed by its stakeholders, who time-lock some of their decentralized credits in exchange for tickets, using these to vote and make decisions about the Decred network and DCR asset's future.

### Amend / Change / Reorder Page copy and headlines here:

> Contributors to the Decred project have a shared ambition, to build a fairer financial system by leveraging open source cryptocurrency software. Decentralized Credits (DCR) are the currency of this fairer financial system, everyone can own and use them - and have a voice in governance of the network if they choose to.

> **The Fiat Currency Game is Rigged**

> Our national fiat currencies and associated payment rails are controlled by a network of elites representing banks and public institutions. Cryptocurrency is about producing an alternative infrastructure for money, which is less susceptible to being captured and controlled by an elite because it is decentralized and permissionless. Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin, which relies on transparent distributed records and a game of computational power to ensure that everyone follows the rules and the network as a whole operates as intended. The consensus rules of the network bind all of its users together, and they stipulate an issuance schedule for the currency, which has been followed faithfully since launch. The distributed network and permissionless mining means it is difficult to stop or censor someone's transactions as long as they follow the network's rules.

> **Blockchain Governance Matters**

> Cryptocurrency networks rely on their software to enforce the rules of the network, known as consensus rules, because it is consensus on how to apply these rules that keeps the network together and functional. Software must be continuously maintained and improved, for cryptocurrencies this means in practice that sometimes the consensus rules need to be amended. Decred was founded on the insight that governance is a major challenge for decentralized networks, because there are many competing interests when it comes to making changes. Decred's solution was to include a formal method of making these decisions from the beginning, so that new users know from the outset how its governance works, transparently managing expectations.

> **Aligned Incentives, Skin in the Game**

> Decred's position is that the best way to decentralize governance of a cryptocurrency fairly is to distribute decision-making power among the people who hold its asset - DCR in this case. However, giving voting rights to everyone who is holding DCR and could immediately sell it is open to abuse. Therefore Decred's design introduced a requirement that in order to participate in Proof-of-Stake voting a user must time-lock some of their DCR to secure a ticket. When stakeholders use DCR to secure a ticket, they cannot spend it until that ticket has voted - which can take up to 142 days. For more information about Proof-of-Stake voting, see the [documentation site](https://docs.decred.org/proof-of-stake/overview/).

**Box footer text:** 

> Learn about Decred's rules, which are the same for everyone, and put the holders of decentralized credits in charge of running the network.

## Website Mockups 

Ideally each RFP proposal would be mocked up on a test site such as has been done [here](https://dcrweb.jamieholdstock.com/).

This would require a little extra help from someone like Jamie and would be a good thing to do for all viable proposals so they can be compared equally.

## About you (or your collective)

Tell us a little bit about your journey to Decred and share any community contributions. 

## Supporting work - estimate costs for changes and help required from others. 

**Make any amends to the below if you are suggesting any extra assets or elements.**

The extra box on the home page would need a background graphic, and the Fair page would need three images. The cost for these to be produced by the same design contributors who worked on the rest of the site is estimated to be $600-1200.

To be consistent with the other pages, the Fair page would need a video. However, the videos are not very prominent on the page so we have decided to forego a new "Fair" video as this would be a significant additional cost and would likely take quite some time to produce.

The new elements follow existing patterns so the amount of work needed to add them on the site is relatively small. @jholdstock has already done the key parts of this to put up the demo site, the estimate for  implementation is $400.

I (@richardred) am estimating the cost of producing the new copy to be $400, which covers the work already done to prepare the draft, plus some time spent considering and implementing feedback on further changes to it.

As decred.org is in 12 languages, this new copy would have to be translated 11 times. I am estimating $100 for each translation for an estimated total of $1,100. This is a difficult one to estimate, and my estimate is based on the information that translation of the other site content took 5-8 hours per language.

## Costs

```markdown
| Item           | Estimated Cost | Maximum Budget |

| Design         | 900            | 1200           |
| Copy           | 400            | 600            |
| Translation    | 1100           | 1400           |
| Implementation | 400            | 600            |
| Total          | 2800           | 3800           |

# Decred messaging proposal - community money

## Overview

There is a [new RFP](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/91becea) on Politiea that invites the Decred community to submit ideas around Decred's messaging. It includes an [example post](https://gist.github.com/RichardRed0x/22c584e7fd9413c1a3f3284069998892) that iterates some of the copy.

In this post, i will critically examine the suggested copy and collect alternative ways of telling Decred's message to the world.


## Thinking through messaging

In any narrative development there are typically four key stages. This approach used by @monsieurbulb gives structure to storytelling and it applies pretty much universally - from business to filmmaking and yes, even crypto-networks.

    Insight - the big picture, what is the context to the story you are telling?

    Problem - within the context you have framed, what is the primary issue?

    Solution - what is the compelling answer to the problem and context you have set?

    How it works - so now explain how the solution works, from high level to deep dive...


Example:

Let's take the (simplified) original positioning of the world's most famous computing brand.

    Insight - Computers will change the world but...

    Problem - Right now they are difficult to use...

    Solution - Introducing Apple. We make computers normal people can use.

    How it works - An intuitive human machine interface etc etc.

You can see how Apple benefitted from Steve Job's marketing insight [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keCwRdbwNQY) and is where the 'Think Different' slogan was born from. Note that the slogan isn't about the technology, it's about what human sensibility the technology appeals to... He uses the same framework, the 'why' comes before the 'what'. 

Let's check Decred's positioning on the current website against this structure.

    Insight - ?

    Problem - ?

    Solution - Introducing Decred, a community directed superior store of value.

    How it works - It is secure. It is sustainable. It is adaptable.

Currently Decred's introduction misses two key steps - context and problem.

For many in the community those steps may be self-evident, but for newcomers and for those less well versed in the history of Bitcoin (aka the vast majority of crypto) it is much harder to grasp the key stages of the story.

An example revison of Decred's positioning statements.

    Insight - The existing financial system is inherently broken...

    Problem - There is no way to reliably store and transact value on the internet, BTC has failed to remain decentralized 

    Solution - Introducing Decred, a community directed superior store of value

    How it works - It is secure, it is sustainable, it is adaptable.

    Details... PoW/PoS hybrid system, treasury reward, Politeia...

The details above are on the website, but the narrative is not immediately clear.

Technology can be world leading, but if the story doesn't connect, the tech alone won't matter. The reverse is also true: great storytelling will take you a long way, but if there aren't strong foundations to back up your claims, then trust will be shortlived. 

#### Lessons to consider 

- The order of text really matters - prioritise. 
- Aim for reduction and simplicity at every stage - this will create impact. 
- Consider the messaging is aimed at reaching and influencing - test it out. 
- Narratives and marketing approaches to explain the project can shift over time. 
- Multiple narratives may coexist, this is something we [see in Bitcoin](https://uncommoncore.co/visions-of-bitcoin-how-major-bitcoin-narratives-changed-over-time/) as well. q

#### Key questions 

What is the core insight at the heart of the message? 

Which audience is the narrative aimed at and why? 

## Examination of current proposal 

The proposed new messaging is: Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money. 

Personally, i think this lacks creativity and vision. It's trying to *describe* the project but uses the wrong words. Let's examine why:

1. every crypto project is stakeholder governed, so that's not unique to DCR. Especially when you use a wide definition of the term stakeholder (benevolent dictators also hold coins). The differentiator rather is: permissionless formal governance systems that are resistant to censorship.
2. while i don't know much about sound money, in two definitions i could find via duckduckgo it says: "Sound money is money that is not prone to sudden appreciation or depreciation in purchasing power over the long term" and "money not liable to sudden appreciation or depreciation in value : stable money". It seems the word "sound" does not really apply to DCR in this definition, because the price at which DCR was valued has changed significantly over the last few years.
3. the RFP also promintently mentions "fairness" which is another questionable word choice. The question "fair for whom? " is relevant here. Maybe Decred is only fair to people who bought DCR for a low price? Because for others it may not feel fair.

To me it seems that the suggested messaging is aimed at people who already understand the project and its fundamentals, not at random newcomers. This will make it difficult to grow Decred beyond the DCR bubble.

## Exploring alternatives 

Everyone has been invited to participate in the messaging RFP. To me, this symbolizes the true spirit of Decred: a digital collective of sovereign individuals who work together to create value.

Institutional investors such as [Blockhead Capital](https://www.blockheadcap.com/post/decred-investment-thesis) and [Placeholder](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2018/5/12/decred-investment-thesis) (among others) have outlined their DCR investment theses and community members have offered [alternative narrative paths](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hg2a9k/forward_thinking_friday_decred_narratives_26_june/). All these different ways of explaing Decred are relevant for this RFP.

It seems that there are 4 messaging categories, each with a different target audience: 

1. cypherpunk, privacy, security, autonomy, freedom, decentralization 
2. number go up, sound money, 21M max, store of value, profit, rewards
3. infrastructure, open source, reliable software, quality developers 
4. relatable stories, inspiration, positivity, celebrities, adoption

Remember: multiple different narratives can coexist. However, we will be more powerful when we create one overarching message that unifies the community. 

### Possible new messaging 

The core insight, to me, is that we live in disruptive times. 

Let's explore this narrative:

    Insights - in current disruptive times, we cannot rely on old systems to preserve our wealth and freedom
    
    Problem - online collaboration to generate and preserve wealth is difficult, especially with random strangers
    
    Solution - introducing Decred, a DAO of sovereign individuals, building the monetary sytems of the future

    How it works - Decred is using decentralized credits, DCR, to create, store, transact and govern value

Our new narrative could be:

* Decred is a DAO of sovereign individuals who work together
* You can pledge allegiance by obtaining decentralized credits
* Together, we make the project Secure, Adaptable, Sustainable 

Final copy should be determined in collaboration with the wider community.

## About me

My story: [noahpierau.github.io](https://noahpierau.github.io/)

Decred community member since day 0.

- I received the Decred airdrop and never sold a single credit from it.
- I worked with _ingsoc and jz to build Decred's community from the ground up. 
- I helped several valued contractors get started with working for Decred. 
- I represented the project on social media and during offline events.


## Estimate of costs for changes + help required from others

I aim to change as little of the existing website as possible, only on the homepage and in other strategic places such as link previews and social media descriptions.

I will co-create the new copy with the community. For free. The only costs go into implementation, to be done in collaboration with existing contractors such as @jholdstock.

As decred.org has 12 languages, this new copy would have to be translated 11 times. I used the estimate of $100 for each translation by Richard Red.

## Costs

| Item           | Estimate | Maximum |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| Design         | 300      | 300     |
| Translation    | 1100     | 1400    |
| Implementation | 400      | 700     |
| Total          | 1800     | 2400    |

# Decred Europe Marketing and Events Proposal

### What?
This proposal will follow the example of the Latam Marketing and Events Proposal. It is a continental effort of contributors in Europe to grow Decred's brand awareness, presence, and adoption in the EU and neighboring countries. The objective of this proposal is to have a dedicated budget for operations in Europe that cover marketing, user support, creation of English content and local translations, community outreach, and – perhaps most importantly - events.

This proposal does not exclude independent contractors in Europe from submitting their own proposal, it is simply intended as a minimum budget. 

### Why?
Europe is home to some of the most forward-thinking crypto communities in the world. Several countries (Malta, Portugal) and cities (Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague) are making an effort to stimulate cryptocurrency and blockchain technology adoption. Decred ambassadors should support these efforts.

### How?
We will only work with Decred Ambassadors who can represent the project in a professional way. The ambassadors will then participate in relevant local crypto communities, network with key players in the region, organize and attend events, and share their success on social media.

### Who?
Decred ambassadors in Europe will collaborate with global Marketing and Events team members such as jz and Dustorf and keep in contact with Decred communities across the world. This proposal is supported by the following independent contractors: haon (Netherlands), jholdstock (England), kozel (Poland), jazzah (Belgium), mm (Portugal) and karamble (Germany). If needed we can headhunt more ambassadors in Europe. 

### General Strategy
- **Awareness:** the first aim is to grow Decred’s presence among existing local crypto communities. The second aim is to reach potential new users of digital currencies. Just like in Latam, our priority will be to target the existing crypto communities with a secondary focus on new audiences. 
- **Adoption:** write and translate guides on how to use the Decred wallets and Lightning Network, attend and organize events around relevant Decred topics, promote the use of DCR as a Store of Value. 
- **Digital Marketing:** local ambassadors should broadcast their activities on their own social media channels. Their posts may be amplified by the @decredproject account(s).
- **User Support:** the ambassadors could act as a first point of contact on social media to resolve technical problems and/or answer general questions about the project.
- **Open Source:** all content must be open source and accessible to everyone in the community.

### Budget Estimation
The estimated budget is $75,000 for the remainder of 2020. We aim to keep the costs as low as possible and any budget that's left at the end of 2020 will remain in the treasury. Ambassador work will be billed to the Treasury in arrears, but only after the work is approved by the global Marketing and Events team. The team also retains the right to block ambassadors from receiving DCR if the delivered work is subpar. Towards the end of 2020 a general report will be shared with the community and a new proposal should be drafted for 2021 to continue activities.

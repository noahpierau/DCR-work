# Data Integrity Draft
In the digital world of today, data has emerged as the lifeblood of various industries and sectors. It powers crucial decision-making processes, enables innovation, and supports economic growth. However, the reliance on data is only as strong as the integrity of that data. 

Data integrity refers to the reliability and trustworthiness of data, meaning that the dataset is complete, accurate, and of high quality. In order to achieve this, it is imperative to communicate transparently about data collection methods and to establish accountability measures. This essay explores the significance of data integrity and it offers suggestions on how to achieve it.


## Why is data integrity important?
It's easy to illustrate the importance of data. According to an older report by McKinsey, organizations that use data to drive their decisions are reaping the benefits[^1]. Data-driven organizations are 23 times more likely to outperform competitors in customer acquisition, 9 times more likely to retain customers, and up to 19 times more profitable.

However, the data-driven attitude of organizations has a significant downside: personal data is quickly becoming a commodity which is collected and sold without consent. Individuals want more visibility and control over how their personal data is used and stored[^2]. Today, the way companies gather and manage individual data varies by region and platform. The ecosystem lacks a consistent and transparent way of gathering these permissions, and individuals are frustrated.

Governments play an important role in shaping and regulating the data ecosystem. The new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework between the EU and the US is the latest example: it includes new commitments regarding the protection of personal data[^3]. In a rapidly evolving regulatory environment, data-driven organizations need to ensure compliance in each of the countries they operate in, or else they risk significant fines[^4][^5]. While these rules may be well-intentioned, restricting data flows can have negative consequences[^6]. Restrictions and regulatory fragmentation may slow down innovation, raise costs for businesses and individuals, and hurt economic growth.

Apart from data protection, we should also be concerned with data integrity. According to Harvard, data integrity relates to the accuracy, completeness, and quality of data as it is maintained over time and across formats[^7]. In a digital world that is increasingly filled with trolls, misinformation, fake news and AI-generated content, preserving the integrity of data is an essential and ongoing process that requires special attention.

Let’s unpack these three aspects of data integrity as defined by Harvard. Completeness ensures that all relevant information is captured, leaving no gaps or missing pieces. Accuracy means that data is free from errors, inconsistencies, or biases. It provides a true representation of the phenomenon or subject being observed. The
high-quality of data means that it is well-structured, easily accessible, and properly validated. High-quality data ensures that it can be effectively utilized over time and serves as a robust foundation for subsequent analyses and decision-making processes.

In today’s world, there are no widely adopted processes of checking if data has been manipulated or corrupted, attributed to the wrong author, or attributed to the wrong time. Additionally, consumers of data are incapable of verifying whether centralized service providers have altered the (meta)data. This could lead to a world of untrustworthy information in which we don’t know how to conclude what is true.


## How to achieve data integrity?
Achieving and maintaining data integrity is paramount for organizations, as it can save valuable resources and ensure sound decision-making. Decisions are only as strong as the integrity of the underlying data. Any compromise in data integrity can have long-lasting and far-reaching negative consequences.

To prioritize data integrity, organizations should implement various measures. The journey begins during the data collection phase. Data collectors need to be transparent about how the data was obtained. Regularly checking for errors, both human-induced and cybersecurity-related, is crucial. Communication and education play a vital role, with the need to instill awareness and best practices among all individuals handling data. 

Transparency can be achieved by implementing best practices for data collection, ensuring that the methods employed are well-documented and publicly accessible. This includes detailing the sources of data, the tools and technologies utilized, and any assumptions or limitations associated with the collection process. By providing a comprehensive overview of data collection methodologies, transparency helps to improve data integrity.

Beyond transparency, accountability is the second crucial element in maintaining data integrity. Data integrity protocols need a layer of accountability which makes it impossible to change informationn unnoticed. This adds an additional line of defense. A key aspect of accountability is keeping track of all entities (or accounts) that update or manipulate the data, including any modifications or alterations, along with timestamps indicating when these changes occurred. This creates an audit trail, allowing for traceability and identification of any potential errors.

To enhance accountability, the use of blockchain technology presents a promising solution. Public blockchains are decentralized, immutable, and transparent ledgers that can record data in a secure and tamper-proof manner. By leveraging timestamping services of public blockchains, data integrity protocols could create permanent and transparent records of all data modifications. The immutability of a blockchain timestamp ensures that any changes made to the data are easily traceable, discouraging fraudulent activities and promoting accountability.

Moreover, public blockchains provide an opportunity to foster a community-driven approach to data integrity. By allowing multiple parties to participate in the verification and validation processes, we could develop decentralized mechanisms for maintaining the integrity of data.


## What are the applications of data integrity protocols?
The world is in need of more protocols that uphold data integrity. Interoperable data integrity protocols could enable peer-to-peer data collection and exchange. With these protocols it would be possible to have full control over our data, share it with trusted partners, and govern it independently. This is essential to achieve sovereignty in the digital economy.

Data integrity protocols enable various applications. Some examples are:

- create unforgeable invoices, avoid fraud
- combat AI-generated deep fakes and impersonation
- provide trusted news via revision-controlled journalism
- issue and verify digital certificates for various use cases
- allow whistleblowers to release sensitive data to the public
- collect intelligence reports about ongoing conflicts or crises
- prove where information has originated to protect intellectual property
- form trusted peer-to-peer networks, enabling decentralized decision-making

## Conclusion
Data is indispensable in the digital age. Organizations should prioritize transparency and accountability to ensure that their data is complete, accurate and of the highest quality. By upholding data integrity, organizations safeguard their foundation for impactful decision-making.

Maintaining data integrity is an ongoing process, demanding a daily commitment to data stewardship. We are in need of more data protocols that help uphold the integrity of our data. By doing so, we can pave the way for a more prosperous digital future.

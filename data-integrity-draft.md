# Data Integrity Draft
In the digital age, data has emerged as the lifeblood of various industries and sectors. It powers crucial decision-making processes, enables innovation, and supports economic growth. However, the reliance on data is only as strong as the integrity of that data. 

Data integrity refers to the reliability and trustworthiness of data, meaning that the dataset is complete, accurate, and of high quality. In order to achieve this, it is imperative to communicate transparently about data collection methods and to establish accountability measures. This essay explores the significance of data integrity and it offers suggestions on how to achieve it.

## Why is data so important?
It's easy to illustrate the importance of data. According to an older report by McKinsey, organizations that use data to drive their decisions are reaping the benefits[^1]. Data-driven organizations are 23 times more likely to outperform competitors in customer acquisition, 9 times more likely to retain customers, and up to 19 times more profitable.

However, the data-driven attitude of organizations has a significant downside: personal data is quickly becoming a commodity which is collected and sold without consent. Individuals want more visibility and control over how their personal data is used and stored[^2]. Today, the way companies gather and manage individual data varies by region and platform. The ecosystem lacks a consistent and transparent way of gathering these permissions, and individuals are frustrated.

Governments play an important role in shaping and regulating the data ecosystem. The new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework between the EU and the US is the latest example: it includes new commitments regarding the protection of personal data[^3]. In a rapidly evolving regulatory environment, data-driven organizations need to ensure compliance in each of the countries they operate in, or else they risk significant fines[^4][^5]. While these rules may be well-intentioned, restricting data flows can have negative consequences[^6]. Restrictions and regulatory fragmentation may slow down innovation, raise costs for businesses and individuals, and hurt economic growth.

Apart from data protection, we should also be concerned with data integrity. Data integrity relates to the accuracy, completeness, and quality of data as it is maintained over time and across formats[^7]. In a digital world that is increasingly filled with trolls, misinformation, fake news and AI-generated content, preserving the integrity of data is an essential process.

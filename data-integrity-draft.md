# Data Integrity Draft
In the digital world of today, data has emerged as the lifeblood of various industries and sectors. It powers crucial decision-making processes, enables innovation, and supports economic growth. However, the reliance on data is only as strong as the integrity of that data. 

Data integrity refers to the reliability and trustworthiness of data, meaning that the dataset is complete, accurate, and of high quality. This essay explores the significance of data integrity and it offers suggestions on how to achieve it.


## Why is data integrity important?
It's easy to illustrate the importance of data. According to an older report by McKinsey, organizations that use data to drive their decisions are reaping the benefits[^1]. Data-driven organizations are 23 times more likely to outperform competitors in customer acquisition, 9 times more likely to retain customers, and up to 19 times more profitable.

However, the data-driven attitude of organizations has a significant downside: personal data is quickly becoming a commodity which is collected and sold without consent. Individuals want more visibility and control over how their personal data is used and stored[^2]. Today, the way companies gather and manage individual data varies by region and platform. The ecosystem lacks a consistent and transparent way of gathering these permissions, and individuals are frustrated.

Governments play an important role in shaping and regulating the data ecosystem. The new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework between the EU and the US is the latest example: it includes new commitments regarding the protection of personal data[^3]. In a rapidly evolving regulatory environment, data-driven organizations need to ensure compliance in each of the countries they operate in, or else they risk significant fines[^4][^5]. While these rules may be well-intentioned, restricting data flows can have negative consequences[^6]. Restrictions and regulatory fragmentation may slow down innovation, raise costs for businesses and individuals, and hurt economic growth.

Apart from data protection, we should also be concerned with data integrity. According to Harvard, data integrity relates to the accuracy, completeness, and quality of data as it is maintained over time and across formats[^7]. In a future that is increasingly filled with trolls, misinformation, fake news and AI-generated content, preserving the integrity of data is an essential and ongoing process that requires special attention.

There are no widely adopted data integrity protocols to check whether data has been manipulated or corrupted, attributed to the wrong author, or attributed to the wrong time. Additionally, consumers of data are incapable of verifying whether centralized service providers have altered their (meta)data. This could lead to a world full of unreliable or untrustworthy information, one in which we don’t know how to conclude what is true.


## How to achieve data integrity?
Achieving and maintaining data integrity is paramount for organizations. Data-driven decisions are only as strong as the integrity of the underlying data. Any breach of integrity can have long-lasting and far-reaching negative consequences.

Let’s unpack the three aspects of data integrity as defined by Harvard. Completeness ensures that all relevant information is captured, leaving no gaps or missing pieces. Accuracy means that the data is free from errors or inconsistencies, and that it provides a true representation of the phenomenon or subject being observed. The quality of data means that it is well-structured and easily accessible, ensuring that it can be effectively updated over time and that it serves as a robust foundation for subsequent analyses.

To achieve data integrity, organizations should prioritize transparency and accountability. The journey begins during the data collection phase. Data collectors need to be transparent about how the data was obtained. Communication and education play a vital role, with the need to implement best practices and to ensure that the methods employed are well-documented and publicly accessible. This includes detailing the sources of data, the tools and technologies utilized, and any assumptions or limitations associated with the collection process.

Beyond transparency, accountability is the second crucial element in achieving data integrity. Data integrity protocols need a layer of accountability which makes it impossible to change informationn unnoticed. This adds an additional line of defense. A key aspect of accountability is keeping track of all entities (or accounts) that update or manipulate the data, including any modifications or alterations, along with timestamps indicating when these changes occurred. This creates an audit trail, allowing for traceability of any potential errors.

To enhance accountability, the use of blockchain technology presents a promising solution. Public blockchains are decentralized, immutable, and transparent ledgers that can record timestamps in a secure and tamper-proof manner. The immutability of a blockchain ensures that every timestamp is permanent, discouraging fraudulent activities and promoting accountability. 

Moreover, public blockchains provide an opportunity to foster a community-driven approach to data integrity. By allowing multiple parties to participate in the verification and validation processes, we could develop decentralized mechanisms for maintaining the integrity of data.


## What are the applications of data integrity protocols?
The world is in need of more protocols that uphold data integrity. Interoperable data integrity protocols could enable peer-to-peer data collection and exchange. With these protocols it would be possible to have full control over our data, share it with trusted partners, and govern it independently. This is essential to achieve sovereignty in the digital economy.

Data integrity protocols enable various applications. Some examples are:

- create unforgeable invoices, avoid fraud
- combat AI-generated deep fakes and impersonation
- provide trusted news via revision-controlled journalism
- issue and verify digital certificates for various use cases
- allow whistleblowers to release sensitive data to the public
- collect intelligence reports about ongoing conflicts or crises
- prove where information has originated to protect intellectual property
- form trusted peer-to-peer datasets, enabling decentralized decision-making

## Conclusion
Data is indespensible in the digital age, demanding a daily commitment to integrity. Organizations should prioritize transparency and accountability to ensure that their data is complete, accurate and of the highest quality. 

We are in need of open source protocols that help us maintain and verify data integrity. The potential applications of such data integrity protocols are hopeful, paving the way to a more prosperous digital future.
